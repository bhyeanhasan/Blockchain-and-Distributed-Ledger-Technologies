Comparative study of Different Hashing Algorithms

1. Implement the following hashing algorithms. Use existing library from Java, Python, etc.,
for implementation.
i. MD5
ii. SHA-1
iii. SHA-2 (256 bit)
iv. SHA-2 (512 bit)
v. SHA-3 (256 bit)
vi. SHA-3 (512 bit)
2. Download 3 text files from https://examplefile.com/
i. 1 GB
ii. 500 MB
iii. 100 MB
3. Using your program, generate hash values for the 3 files for each of the algorithms with
prefix 000XYZ, where XXX = Last 3 digits of your student ID.
4. Identify running time for each input file for the selected algorithms
5. Prepare a report with
1. Details of the library used for analysis
2. Screenshots of the outputs
3. Computer spec
4. Hash values
5. Comparative analysis
6. Submit the report in Teams in PDF format.
